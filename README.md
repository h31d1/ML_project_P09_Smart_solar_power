- We have made some predictions for data loaded from Meteo

- Heidi made data cleansing and trained the cleaned data with Random Forest 

Prediction ideas
- Let's try to predict by month or by season. E.g fit june, predict june.
- Let's try XGBoost
- Heidi creates the function for data cleansing that everybody can use the same set of data.
