# ML_project_P09_Smart_solar_power
The project P09 "Smart Solar Power" for Machine Learning course 2021/2022 autumn

**Meeting 11.11.2021**

- Presentation discussion
  - Mart creates the presentation
  - Topics
    - What data we have, how do we use it
    - What is our goal
    - What models we will use/try
    - Materials we have found: previous work
- Discussion about first sight on the data
  - What attribute will be predicted
  - Attributes which impact the most

Next: intermediate presentation on Monday 15.11.2021

Next meeting: 18.11.2021 17:00

**Meeting 18.11.2021**

- We have made some predictions for data loaded from Meteo
- Mart found the closest function for the radiation flux means
- Heidi made data cleansing and trained the cleaned data with Random Forest 

Prediction ideas
- Let's try to predict by month or by season. E.g fit june, predict june.
- Let's try XGBoost
- Heidi creates the function for data cleansing that everybody can use the same set of data.

Next meeting 25.11.2021 17:00

**Meeting 25.11.2021**

- During meeting we dealt with cleansing of the files Mart uploaded to git and we ran the Random Forest on it.
- Siim found some sources where we could get the cloudiness values for predictions. Need to use API.
- No other models yet tried.
- Siim will contact Ott Keki≈°ev to ask more data for predictions as it is not enough to predict the radiation flux. 
  We need also the cloudiness rate and the coefficient of the solar panel.
